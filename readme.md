## Project 4 - ReVisit
Revisit is a digital diary to explore times and places in your life. Each entry is able to contain a picture, with a description of the picture, the date of occurrence, and also displays the user who made that entry. Users can also make chapters, which contain a collection of posts. Users can upload music to their chapters; the idea is they choose a song that reminds them of those memories. Between the pictures, music, date, and description, people can re-experience some of the feelings associated with that time in their life.

## Getting Started
After forking/cloning, dont forget to run `npm install`. S3 will not work locally unless you use your own keys and create a config file in the root containing 'auth.js' (which contains your keys). Also you must require 'auth.js' in the server.js . Also must replace all heroku urls with the localhost url where you will be running locally.
